# Solution Protocol (KISS)

**Trigger:** User requests solution/approach for a problem or requirement

**Process:**
1. Acknowledge: "Proposing solution â†’ saving to `.cursor/memory/`"
2. Analyze requirement, propose **simplest viable solution**
3. **MUST save** to `.cursor/memory/YYYYMMDD-VV-solution-description.md` (VV = daily 01,02...). VV increments sequentially per day (never reuse VV values)
4. Confirm: "Solution saved to `.cursor/memory/[filename]`"

**Content:** Natural markdown covering: problem summary, proposed approach (KISS first), implementation steps, trade-offs

**Principles:** 
- Simplicity > complexity
- Proven patterns > novel approaches
- Minimal dependencies
- Avoid over-engineering

**Rules:** NEVER skip save. If multiple valid approaches, present simplest first. ASK if requirements unclear. DO NOT WRITE CODE YET, wait for further instructions

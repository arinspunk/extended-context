# Analysis Protocol

**Trigger:** @file/@folder without instructions, or "analyze/review/audit/document"

**Process:**
1. Acknowledge: "Analyzing [name] â†’ saving to `.cursor/memory/`"
2. Analyze: purpose, architecture, dependencies, issues, recommendations
3. **MUST save** to `.cursor/memory/YYYYMMDD-VV-description.md` (VV = daily 01,02...). VV increments sequentially per day (never reuse VV values)
4. Confirm: "Analysis saved to `.cursor/memory/[filename]`"

**File content:** Natural markdown with findings - no strict template, focus on what matters for future reference.

**Rules:** NEVER skip save. ASK if scope unclear. DO NOT WRITE CODE YET, wait for further instructions
